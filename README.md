# crash-course

An experimental Phaser.js game.

This is an endless track game where you have to steer your car away from oncoming bricks that get faster the higher you score.  
You have 3 lives, on losing each life, you lose 30% of your score at that moment.  

Here in this screenshot, you can see one of the bricks bursting into flames as the car crashes into it.

_Such dramatic, much flames, very wow._
